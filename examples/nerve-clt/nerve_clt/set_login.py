"""This module provides an implementation for setting and storing login credentials for the Nerve management system.

It supports fetching credentials from various sources, including command-line arguments, environment variables,
credentials stored in a file, and user input.
Additionally, it attempts to login with these credentials and saves the session ID for further use.
This module is a part of the TTTech Industrial Automation AG's nerveapi package, intended to streamline the process of
interacting with the Nerve management system.

    """Handles setting and storing login credentials for the Nerve management system.

    This function attempts to fetch login credentials from various sources in a prioritized order:
    1. Command-line arguments provided by the user.
    2. Environment variables set in the system.
    3. Credentials stored in a specified file.
    4. Direct user input if the above methods do not yield credentials.

    After obtaining the credentials, it attempts to log in to the Nerve management system. If successful, the session
    ID is saved for future use. Additionally, the user is given the option to save these credentials for later use.

    Parameters:
    args (Namespace): An argparse Namespace object containing potential URL, username, and password among other
    command-line arguments.

    Returns:
    None: The function primarily prints to console and saves session information, without returning any value.
