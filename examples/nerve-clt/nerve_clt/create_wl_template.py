def handle_create_wl_template(args):
    """Handles the creation of a workload template based on an input JSON file.

    This function loads a workload list from a specified JSON file, then fetches detailed information
    for the first workload in the list from the management system. It supports workloads of type 'docker'
    and rewrites the definition to create a template from which a new workload can be created. The resulting
    template is saved to a specified output file.
    Note that only the first workload in the list is considered for creating the template but that all versions of this
    workload are considered. If you want to create only one version, remove the others from the input file.


    Parameters:
    - args: A namespace object from argparse containing command-line arguments. Expected to have
            'input_file' and 'output_file' attributes specifying the input and output JSON filenames,
            and a 'verbose' attribute to control verbose output.

    Returns:
    - None: The function writes the resulting template to a file and does not return a value.
